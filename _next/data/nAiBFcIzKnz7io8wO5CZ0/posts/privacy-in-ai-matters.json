It's about maintaining control over digital identity. AI systems process everything from browsing patterns to biometric data, creating detailed profiles that reveal far more than any single data point would suggest.\n\nThe scale is staggering. A typical large language model trains on hundreds of billions of data points.

A single breach can expose millions of conversations, queries, and personal details simultaneously.\n\n**Inference Attacks**: Even anonymized data can be de-anonymized. AI itself can reconstruct personal information from seemingly harmless metadata.\n\n**Model Memorization**: Large language models can inadvertently memorize and reproduce sensitive information from their training data, including private conversations and personal details.\n\n**Behavioral Profiling**: Continuous interaction with AI services generates behavioral patterns that can predict decisions, preferences, and vulnerabilities.\n\n## The Local Alternative\n\nThe architecture of AI deployment matters enormously for privacy. When AI runs locally on a device:\n\n- Data never leaves the hardware\n- No server logs capture queries\n- No third party can access conversations\n- Users maintain complete control over what the model sees\n\nThis isn't about having something to hide. It's about the principle that thoughts, questions, and creative explorations belong to the individual.\n\n## Privacy-First AI\n\nAI capability and strong privacy aren't mutually exclusive.
